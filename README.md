## Project Overview
In this project you will apply JavaScript to the DOM to create a greeting card on an HTML page.  

## Objectives

- [ ] Create HTML elements
- [ ] Use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements
- [ ] Use variables to manage data

## Specifications

Create a Greeting Card on an HTML page.  Your Greeting Card should include at least 10 different HTML elements.  You must use JavaScript (only) to create and manipulate your elements in such a way that they come together to clearly resemble a picture.   Your Greeting Card should include a variety of colors (at least 5), text, an image, and music. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the index.html page.  Here you will create the basic elements for your page.  You must include at least 10 different elements. 
- [ ] Locate the App.js file.  Write code to manipulate the elements on your index.html page
- [ ] Include music with your GreetingCard.  Below is an example of how to do this, 

```
var au = new Audio("Music/AllIWantForChristmas.mp3");
au.controls = true;
document.body.appendChild(au);
```

## Overview

This Webpage displays two animations that appear based on user input.
If you click the red button, the text changes and  a new "animation" appears.
## Compiling and Using

That's a really funny question.... Wait are you being serious?


In order to load you need to clone the repository and open index.html in any browser of choice. Or you could <a href="https://timberlinecs.github.io/greeting-card-FlyingPotato5/">use the live link.</a> In order to hear music you must click on the screen at least once. If you want to see the second screen, click on the red button

## Discussion

When I realized  I wanted to have the music play automatically I found out about a lovely little browser update the prevents music from being automatically played without user input. I guess it makes sense and made me wonder about how internet/browser regulations had evolved from the wilder west days of the 90's, and thinking if this update broke any websites that relied on being able to play audio automatically anymore.

## Extra Credit

uhhh i added user input that's all i got.
